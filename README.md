# logarithmotechnia

This project is an implementaton of a dataframe akin to Python's Pandas or R's tibble. R's influence are significantly stronger for this project, although I do borrow ideas from Pandas as well. 

Main sales points are better data organization (than, say, in Gota); full support of NA-values (unlike some dataframes for Go); good extensibility (unlike all currently existing packages). 

Extimated release of first public version is April-May 2023.
