# Logarithmotechnia

This project is an implementaton of a dataframe akin to Python's Pandas or R's tibble. R's influence are significantly stronger for this project, although I do borrow ideas from Pandas as well. 

Main sales points are decent data organization (better than, say, in Gota); full support of NA-values (unlike some dataframes for Go); good extensibility (unlike all currently existing packages): it is much more easier to create your own vector (series) types than in other competitors. 

Estimated release of first public version is April-May 2023.
